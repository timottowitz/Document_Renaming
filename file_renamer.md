Key Features:

Intelligent Ingestion:

Monitors specific "intake" folders (e.g., Scans_Incoming, Client_Uploads, Email_Attachments_Pending_Review).

Can be triggered manually for batches of existing files.

AI-Powered Content Analysis:

Extracts text from various file formats (PDFs, DOCX, EML, MSG, images via OCR).

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the document's purpose, key dates, parties involved, and other relevant legal entities.

Entity Recognition & Extraction (The "System with Entities"):

Predefined Entities: The system will be configured with entities crucial for law firms:

ClientName / ClientID

CaseName / CaseNumber / MatterID

DocumentType (e.g., Pleading, Motion, Contract, Correspondence, Invoice, Discovery, Order, Judgment, Affidavit, Exhibit)

DocumentDate (Creation, Filing, Received, Effective)

Author / Sender / Recipient

Jurisdiction (if applicable)

Version (e.g., Draft, Final, v1, v2)

Status (e.g., Filed, Executed, Served)

BriefDescription (AI-generated short summary or key terms)

Custom Entities: Ability to add firm-specific entities.

Configurable Naming Convention:

The firm defines a clear, structured naming convention template.

Example: [CaseNumber]_[ClientShortName]_[DocumentType]_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[BriefDescription]_[Version].[ext]

Result: 2023-101-AB_AcmeCorp_MotionToDismiss_2023-10-26_SummaryJudgment_Final.pdf

AI Model Integration (Inspired by the Video):

Primary Model: Likely a powerful LLM (GPT-4, Gemini Advanced, Claude 3) for high accuracy in entity extraction and understanding complex legal documents.

Local/Open Source Options (for cost/privacy/customization):

Ability to connect to local models via Ollama, LlamaCPP, LMStudio for processing less sensitive or bulk data.

Fine-tunable models for firm-specific jargon and document types.

Whisper API Integration: For transcribing audio/video files and then processing the transcript for renaming.

User Interface (UI) & Workflow:

Dashboard: Shows files pending review, processing queue, and recently renamed files.

Review & Confirmation:

Presents the original filename, a preview (if possible), extracted entities, and the AI-suggested new filename.

Allows users to easily edit extracted entities or the suggested name.

"One-click" rename or "Rename All Suggested" for batches.

Option to flag problematic suggestions for model retraining.

Settings Panel:

Manage API keys for different AI services.

Configure naming convention templates.

Define and manage entities.

Manage intake folders.

User roles and permissions.

Training & Improvement:

Initial Training/Prompting: Use few-shot prompting with examples of correctly named files and their corresponding content snippets.

Fine-tuning (Advanced):

Collect a dataset of (document content, extracted entities, correct filename).

Fine-tune a base model (e.g., an open-source model) on this dataset for improved accuracy on firm-specific document types and entities.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): User corrections to suggested names and entities can be logged and used periodically to refine the model.

Integration & Deployment:

Could be a standalone desktop application or a web application accessible within the firm's network.

Potential for integration with Document Management Systems (DMS).

"MCP Server + AI": The AI core could run on a dedicated server (the "MCP Server"), with client applications (or even scripts) interacting with it.

System Design & Components:

File Ingestor/Watcher:

Monitors designated folders or accepts manual uploads.

Sends new files to the Pre-processing Queue.

Pre-processor:

File Type Identification: Determines the type of file.

Text/Content Extractor: Uses libraries like Tika, PyPDF2, python-docx, OCR (e.g., Tesseract) for images, Whisper for audio/video.

Metadata Extractor: Pulls existing metadata (author, creation date, etc.).

AI Core Engine:

Orchestrator: Manages the flow of data to and from AI models.

Prompt Engine: Generates dynamic prompts for the LLM based on the file content, metadata, and desired entities.

AI Model Interface: Handles API calls to selected AI models (OpenAI, Gemini, local Ollama, etc.).

Entity Extraction Module: Parses AI model responses to isolate the defined entities.

Naming Convention Formatter: Applies the firm's rules to the extracted entities to construct the new filename.

Database:

Stores configuration (API keys, naming rules, entities).

Logs processed files, original names, suggested names, user actions.

Stores data for fine-tuning and RLHF.

User Interface (UI) Application:

Provides the dashboard, review/confirmation screen, and settings.

Communicates with the AI Core Engine.

Workflow Example:

A paralegal scans a 20-page contract and saves it as scan_001.pdf into the Scans_Incoming folder.

LexiRename's File Watcher detects the new file.

The Pre-processor performs Vision/OCR, extracts text and any metadata.

The AI Core Engine sends the text to the configured LLM with a prompt like:
"Analyze the following document text. Identify: Client Name, Opposing Party, Document Type (e.g., Contract, Agreement, Lease), Effective Date, and a very brief 3-5 word description. Format dates as YYYY-MM-DD. Document Text: [Extracted Text Here]" - define structured json outputs for specific files 

The LLM responds with the extracted entities.

The Naming Convention Formatter uses the firm's template: [CaseNumber]_[ClientName]_[DocumentType]_[EffectiveDate]_[BriefDescription].pdf. (Note: CaseNumber might need manual input or be inferred if the file is dropped into a case-specific subfolder later).

LexiRename UI shows:

Original: scan_001.pdf

Suggested: [PendingCaseNo]_MegaCorp_ServiceAgreement_2023-11-15_TechServices.pdf

Extracted Entities: Client: MegaCorp, Type: Service Agreement, Date: 2023-11-15, etc.

The paralegal reviews, perhaps adds the CaseNumber (e.g., 2023-M-045), and clicks "Rename."

The file is renamed to 2023-M-045_MegaCorp_ServiceAgreement_2023-11-15_TechServices.pdf and potentially moved to the appropriate case folder.

Addressing the "Folder Picker" Issue from the Video:
The folder picker issue mentioned is specific to the UI of the application in the video. In LexiRename, we would ensure:

A robust and intuitive file/folder selection dialog.

Clear visual cues for selected items.

Easy deselection.

If processing involves moving files to a destination folder after renaming, that selection process would also be clear and error-resistant.

This system would be a significant step up from manual renaming or simple template-based renamers, leveraging AI's power to understand context and content, which is crucial for legal documents. The ability to integrate various AI models makes it future-proof and adaptable to the firm's budget and privacy requirements.
